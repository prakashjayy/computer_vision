Computer vision course essentials. The course is in Keras but the following links mostly deal with Pytorch. So, this course is just intended for learning concepts.

# Advanced concepts 
- GANS
- DeepFakes 
- Self-supervisied learning 
- Zero, one or few shot learning 

# Usecases

## object detection: 
- crowd counting (image) and tracking (video) 

## semantic segmentation
- In satellite images, identify the area of forest cover, roads, [ships](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/data)

## Instance segmentation: (semantic segmentation + object detection)
- In satellite images, segment buildings area and count the total area occupied and count of total buildings.
- Find the each nuclei size (segmentation) and total count of nuclei object detection [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/overview)
